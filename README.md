## Extension Automation 
Automatically enables and disables extensions for specified sites. For simpler browsing and better performance.

It was developed over 4 years ago, but is no longer maintained, so I put it online for those who want to tweak it. It was written before I read Javascript: The Good Parts, so the code is a bit on the ugly side. The manifest is also not updated with chrome's frequently changing manifest specifications.


### Instructions
#### How to Use

This extension can enable or disable your other Google Chrome extensions based on the websites you have open. For instance, if you want to enable one of your extensions when you're on facebook, choose Enable, then choose the extension you want to automate, then type in 'facebook.com'. Or, if you want to keep an extension disabled unless your on a certain website, choose Disable, choose an extension, then type in the website.

#### Managing Settings

Once you have some entries saved, you can modify them in the table on the options page. If you want to switch between enabling and disabling an extension, click the icon for that extension. When an extension is being disabled for your keywords, the icon will be crossed out. If you want to delete one of your keyword filters, simply click on that word and it will be erased.

#### Import and Export Settings

To save your preferences to a different account or computer, select all the text in the top "import" text input, paste it in the bottom "export" box, then click "Import". Unfortunately, this extension does not synchronize automatically with your Google chrome profile right now, but this is a quick solution for importing/exporting settings. (You can even try to edit your settings by hand if you want -- at your own risk!)
